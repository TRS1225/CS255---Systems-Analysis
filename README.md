# CS255---Systems-Analysis
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a business that offers driving educational training and courses to students in order to help their chances of passing tests at the DMV. They wanted to design essentially an online web service which allowed customers to take training courses both online and on the road.

# What did you do particularly well?

I understood the end goal of the client well and if it were a real life project, I would have delivered exactly what the client asked for.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to finish and turn in the powerpoint presentation in the final week, as I ran out of time to turn it in before the deadline.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by imagining myself in their shoes. The questions I asked were, "what would I want expect out of a business which offered these services? 

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I take an incremental approach when designing software. I try not to finish an entire program or design in one sitting or day unless the program or system is very simple and straightforward without requiring much time or planning to accomplish.
